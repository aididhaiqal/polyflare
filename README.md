# PolyFlare

A multi-provider LLM-CLI load balancer, in Rust.

PolyFlare fronts a pool of provider accounts (OpenAI Codex / ChatGPT and Anthropic to start), speaks multiple client wire formats, translates between them where needed, and routes each request to the best available account — presenting the native CLI's fingerprint on egress. It is the Rust successor to [codex-lb](https://github.com/Soju06/codex-lb), adopting the multi-provider translation model from [CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI) and the Anthropic-pool + dashboard ideas from [better-ccflare](https://github.com/tombii/better-ccflare).

> **Status: early / work in progress.** Milestone 1 (Codex identity pass-through) is underway. Not yet a daily driver.

## Why a rebuild

Two problems in the existing tools motivate building from scratch rather than refactoring:

1. **Continuity done right.** Cross-account `previous_response_id` anchoring can *wedge* a conversation when a `store:false` full-resend is trimmed to an anchor the upstream never persisted. PolyFlare models continuity as an explicit per-conversation **state machine with a watchdog**, so a non-resuming anchor is always detected and recovered instead of stalling.
2. **A real egress fingerprint.** Faking a `User-Agent` on a Python TLS stack still ships a mismatched TLS handshake. Rust's TLS control lets PolyFlare match the native CLI's fingerprint, not just its headers.

Full design: [`docs/POLYFLARE-DESIGN.md`](docs/POLYFLARE-DESIGN.md). The reasoning behind every decision (with trade-offs and revisit-triggers): [`docs/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md`](docs/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md).

## Architecture

A single [tokio](https://tokio.rs) binary. A provider-neutral core — a `Format` enum plus a translator registry — is the spine; Codex and Anthropic are both first-class backends behind five traits: `Translator`, `Executor`, `Selector`, `Continuity`, `Coordinator`. Adding a provider means registering a translator and an executor, never a rewrite.

| Crate | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `polyflare-core` | `Format` enum, translator registry, core types, the five traits |
| `polyflare-codex` | Codex backend: WS/SSE transport, fingerprint laundering, continuity |
| `polyflare-anthropic` | Anthropic backend: HTTP transport, rate-limit semantics *(M4)* |
| `polyflare-store` | SQLite persistence + at-rest crypto *(M2)* |
| `polyflare-testkit` | Scriptable mock upstreams for e2e tests |
| `polyflare-server` | axum ingress, auth, config, wiring — and the `polyflare` binary |

## Build & test

```sh
cargo build
cargo test
```

Run the proxy against a Codex-compatible upstream (M1):

```sh
POLYFLARE_UPSTREAM_URL="https://<upstream-base>" \
POLYFLARE_UPSTREAM_TOKEN="<oauth-bearer>" \
POLYFLARE_BIND="127.0.0.1:8080" \
cargo run --bin polyflare
```

Secrets are read from the environment only and never logged.

To capture a real Codex CLI request's content-safe structural HTTP fingerprint (the golden fixture
the M5 fingerprint-parity gate diffs against — method, path, header names, and redacted/structural
value descriptors only; never a token, id, or body), set `POLYFLARE_CAPTURE_FINGERPRINT` to a file
path before routing one real `codex-rs` request through PolyFlare:

```sh
POLYFLARE_CAPTURE_FINGERPRINT="./fingerprint_golden.jsonl" \
POLYFLARE_UPSTREAM_URL="https://<upstream-base>" \
cargo run --bin polyflare -- serve
```

Each request appends one JSON line to the golden path (JSON Lines); see
`crates/polyflare-server/src/fingerprint_capture.rs` for the exact redaction rules.

## Roadmap

- **M1** — Skeleton + Codex identity pass-through ← *in progress*
- **M2** — Store + accounts + selector + zero-re-auth OAuth import
- **M3** — Continuity engine (the wedge fix)
- **M4** — Anthropic executor + `Anthropic → Codex` translator
- **M5** — Byte-identical fingerprint + latency/parity CI gates + observability

## Responsible use

PolyFlare load-balances provider accounts **you own and are authorized to use**. You are responsible for complying with the terms of service of every provider you connect it to. Don't use it to share, pool, or resell access you don't have.
